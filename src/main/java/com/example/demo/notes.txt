What is a singleton?

* spring container creates only one instance of the bean, by default
* it is cached in memory
* all requests for the bean
* * will return a shared reference to the same bean

b) Prototype - creates a new bean instance for each container request.
c) Request - scoped to an HTTP web request. Only used for web apps.
